Pathfinding is used in many different cases, ranging from Transportation (Uber) and Directions (Google Maps) to sending files through a network efficently. We aimed to create a program that will allow the user to see what is going on behind the scenes during the actual pathfinding. We implemented A* search and Breadth First Search as our main algorithms.
