# PathFindingVisualizer 

## Eden Prairie Team

## Authors: Rohan S. Ramki P. Ashwin M. Will A. Raghava U.

Pathfinding is used in many different cases, ranging from Transportation (Uber) and Directions (Google Maps) to sending files through a network efficently. We aimed to create a program that will allow the user to see what is going on behind the scenes during the actual pathfinding. We implemented A* search and Breadth First Search as our main algorithms. 

To see this project, start by cloning it into a directory

```
git clone https://github.com/futuristacademy/PathFindingVisualizer.git
```
Then use some sort of cmd tool or Java IDE to open the project and run it.

## Controls

Holding down C + mouse move will automatically create walls as you move past the tiles

Holding down E + mouse move will automatically erase walls as you move past the tiles

Clicking on the Start and End points will allow you to change them to different places

Clicking A will set the algorithm to A* and Clicking B will set the algorithm to BFS
